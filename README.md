# Green Team's Info 201 Final Project

We will be using the [Seattle Police Department Police Report Incident](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Police-Department-Police-Report-Incident/7ais-f98f) dataset to help our audience learn if there has been an increase or decrease in crime overtime, what are the most common types of crime, and which areas/locations in Seattle has the highest crime rate.
